    <Paragraph>It took me a while to get completely addicted to scuba diving...</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>A first dive in Australia in 2003, followed by a second in Croatia a year later, but still not the catch...</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>I finally passed my first level somewhat by chance during a stay in Martinique in March 2005, but it was really at the beginning of 2006, in the Bahamas, when I came across a hammerhead shark that everything changed...</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>Diving then became a real passion and I quickly passed my level 2 in May 2006 to continue my progress towards N3, then N4 in June 2008, and finally the initiator a year later.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>In parallel with my technical levels, I also became interested very early in underwater biology and during this first season 2006-2007, I will follow the courses of the Departmental Committee of Paris which will lead me to the validation of the first submarine biology level after a training week at Cerb√®re with Robert Oms.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>One thing led to another, after the bio, I naturally became interested in underwater photography...And so here I went to the Maldives in February 2008, equipped with a Nikon P5100 in an Ikelite housing, with a DS125 strobe the same brand.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>The first results are rather encouraging and as I learn the manual settings of the camera, the switch to reflex becomes obvious.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>So I switched to the Nikon D90 in July 2009, in an Aquatica housing, still with my trusty DS125 strobe, to which I will associate a newer DS160.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>After 5 years with my D90, I then moved to the D7100 then the D7200, which both share the same Aquatica housing.</Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>In the meantime, this site was simply born from the desire to share this passion with family and friends, and it was at the beginning of 2022 that this 6th version saw the light of day...</Paragraph>
